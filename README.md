# ps239T-final-project

## Introduction

This is my final project repo for PS239T, a computational tools course taught out of the political science department at UC - Berkeley. My project focuses on a potential research project of mine that aims to use a full-profile conjoint to be able to parse out potentially hidden or underlying attitudes on welfare and welfare recipients. The final project for this course is a pilot of this conjoint to troubleshoot and to get *some* substantive data to play around with.

A majority of my time on this final project was spent in Qualtrics, creating a survey that was later put up as a HIT on MTurk. My Qualtrics survey is fairly heavily coded using JavaScript (and some HTML) to randomize both the order of my profile dimensions, the profile attributes themselves, and to ensure that these randomizations could be saved and exported for my later analysis.

## Conclusion/Contact Information/Acknowledgements

For technical guidance, my thanks to Rachel Bernhard and Kyle Dropp. A large inspiration for this project is an article by Hainmueller and Hopkins (2014). Huge thanks to Rachel Bernhard for making a computational tools class enjoyable and as free of stress as possible for a computational tools class.

If you stumble upon this repository and have any questions/comments/suggestions etc please contact me at csteclaire@berkeley.edu. I already have some future updating and directions for this research from classmates and can always use extra input. Thanks!
